ðŸ‘‹ Hello, my name is @DuubuDubuu ðŸ‘€ and I graduated from San Beda University. Head Technical Support role in an IT Organization at San Beda University for three years.
Currently, I'm interested in full stack development and various programming languages. and at the moment, I'm learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript. If given a chance to   collaborate, I'd like to work on HTML CSS and Javascript projects to hone my skills.
